# ROBLOX Flamework, Rojo & Remodel CI/CD Template!

This template is a scaffold for ROBLOX Development using Flamework as a development framework and Rojo+Rebuild for sync & state management.

Initialize by running `yarn install`, followed by `yarn init-tools`. Depends on rust cargo for toolchain management.

Assets can be created in `rbx/places/assets.rbxlx` and built using `yarn pull-assets`.
